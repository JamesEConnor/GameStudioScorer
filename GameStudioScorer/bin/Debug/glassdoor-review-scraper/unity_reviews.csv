I have not dealt with so much crap my entire career. HR allowed passive bullying to continue with advice of just ignore it. I was asked by a VP to add a good company review as they were getting too many bad ones! Management cares less about your low pay, reviews or career progression. Zero ongoing training, career plan or KPI's leaving you to just do your own thing.. even if you do great there is no mention of formal reviews and you'll be chasing for follow up for months on end.

Hiring bar varies from team to team, even time to time. You might end up working with someone with low productivity but high ego. Also keep in mind that different org is like a different universe, R&D only cares about unity engine, Ads is like its own company, Services is like the middle child that no one care.","We need stronger leadership, if there is a clear direction/goal every org should be working towards, CEO & CTO needs to advocate it over and over again, in every all hands. And to keep good people, pay them above market rate. When most good people left, whoever left behind are either forced to stay due to family/etc reason -- they won't work hard, or the source of the problem itself -- they will drive good people out.",2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

There is free food. But the Engineering team is incredibly underpaid and overworked.,Bad managers and everyone is leaving because of it especially in Engineering. Salary is way below market. No bonuses unless you are a Director. Stock options are very low.,Fix the culture. It used to be fun to work at Unity.

The company gives you a chance to know them better via history and team introduction.

Few teams/ team members do not like each other, you will feel like fighting a battle just to get some work done. 2. Too frequent changes in upper management has created chaos with no clear direction about the product. 3. Appraisal process is inconsistent. 4. Recruiter might lie about pre ipo stock value, Unity took a hefty round of funding last year, stock has been diluted significantly. 5. Unity has its own way of making work more stressful, you will feel like a lot is on stake and you will be judged.","Even if you consider half of the Glassdoor and blind reviews are true, there is something terribly wrong, fix them.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

Sat Mar 16 2019 00:53:58 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time),,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,Management Worst Practices,I have been working at Unity Technologies full-time for more than a year,16,An amazing product and community,"The senior leadership in the sales and marketing team is in full empire-building mode. Their top-down communication, with extremly limited understanding of proper problem scoping, process and data management, is debilitating growth and efficiency. Their asks are consistently communicated around ""What I need is..."" and CC'ed to numerous stakeholders, addressed to no one in particular, to circumvent the ""flat hierarchy"" defined by limited structure, no clear role definitions and responsibilities. It is evident that Unitys growth has come despite and not because of its sales and marketing efforts. In the past 2 years, customer complaints have increased, employee attrition has significantly risen and only now did someone think it a good idea to provide a management feedback survey, which will highlight the dismal people management practices. Colleagues are continously asked to work later and not smarter, double-work is the rule not the exception and people are treated as production components instead of human beings. Career development conversations come about from bottom-up requests instead of management priorities and the scale-up hiring spree that Unity has been on has left numerous employees without proper onboarding, training and support. 1 manager to 10-12 reports is a symptom and so are the complaints of people being hired for people management roles and then coming into individual contributor roles with individual sales targets.","To the C-level leaders, go speak with your leadership teams direct reports and get a true picture of what the state of your organization abd people is.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
Sun Jan 20 2019 21:32:22 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time),,"San Francisco, CA",Current Employee ,A few pros but a lot of cons,I have been working at Unity Technologies full-time for more than a year,32, A fun place to work. People are very nice and approachable. This is the best part about Unity. - Food is pretty good but if you work late they don't provide dinner. - Snack quality is declining but it's there. - Paid health insurance. 100 bucks wellness benefits and 401k matching. - Work life balance is pretty good if you end up on the right team.," Filter out all the fake reviews that are obviously posted by recruiters trying to bank some commission. There are lots of them and they are not accurate portrayal of what's going on inside Unity. - Low caliber talent pool. Unity is desperate for coders and the hiring bar has suffered as a result of that. It's hard to count on people to get their stuff done. - Performance review is extremely unstructured. It's very hard to take perf review seriously at Unity. Whatever you say will go unnoticed and it seems to have no effect towards compensation. - Low caliber managers. Anyone .... literally anyone can become a manager at Unity. If you want a 'lead' title, Unity shall provide. If you suck, no worries there is no consequence. You can always revert back to IC. - Last but not least, if you are financially motivated. This is not the place for you. No target bonus. Compensation change is rare and stock package is a joke.",,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We did a good job of hiring smart, nice folks at least in my team. People come to work wanting to do better. We are playing catching up when it comes to process, due to the fast growth. C-Suite seems to know what they are doing. The strategy outlined when I started was executed (except for the Analytics org). I'm very excited about Unity's future.",Based on the comments on Blind and Glassdoor: We made a few mistakes hiring people who have no interest/business being there. This could become a serious problem for Unity and impact the Company Culture.,Move more quickly when part of the organization isn't working. Reinforce the Unity Culture and don't hire and root out people with a mercenary outlook. Unity can't afford to be part of the Silicon Valley revolving door.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Fri Nov 09 2018 20:10:17 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time), Product Marketing,"San Francisco, CA",Former Employee ,Behind the rosy facade there are serious problems,I worked at Unity Technologies full-time for more than a year,40," A workplace full of smart, driven people - A powerful and popular gaming engine - Great recruiters and wework team - Nice office perks - Near Bart", As others have mentioned - Toxic environment - Game of Thrones politics in some groups - Poor senior staff with regards to transparency and communication - Feedback on process and design is asked for and not enacted,"As a woman, I was so happy to join a place with strong female VPs. I took the leadership training course at the end of my six months. Then I learned everything taught in those sessions was not practiced by these VPs. I realized that the female leadership at Unity follows the same flawed rulebook of many tech companies - petty politics, no top-down management, mood swings, and wildly flawed expectations. John, enact 360 reviews for VPs and Directors. Their bonus % should be gated on receiving positive marks from their staff and colleagues.",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0
