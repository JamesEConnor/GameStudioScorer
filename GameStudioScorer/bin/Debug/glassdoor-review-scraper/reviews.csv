"Heavy technical debt and lack of organization.Very long periods of crunch.Low pay given the cost of living in the area.Lack of vision and ability to say ""No""; need to focus on making the core gameplay fun rather than adding another unpolished vestigial feature.",2.0

Boss system is killing me. A lot of support tickets,5.0
Working 14 hours a day 6 days a week for 6 months is no way to live. The games are important but people you work with are even more important than that it's funny how they call it a family...especially since not all of us are making the BIG $$$.,1.0
work life balance could improve,4.0
They treat you bad. There is no company culture and you have to work a lot overtime late in the evenings.,2.0
 Leadership is earned by seniority aka. whoever put up with this bs the longest therefore managers or directors aren't necessarily suitable for the leadership position. - There is no career development. Leadership doesn't care about any of that. They only care for face time. - Politics are everything. If you're in a position where Rockstar North has less skill but a much bigger ego you're the loser. - Toxic masculinity everywhere. Women's opinions aren't acknowledged and always taken with lesser priority than the male counterparts. - You either drink the cool aid hard or you're going to have a hard time. - There's no company culture. Departments don't intermingle. - The company made billions of dollars through SharkCards last year but they keep telling us that there is no money for a Christmas party or for bigger bonuses.,2.0
Lower management is full of grumpy people who hate their jobs but never quit. They ruin the experience of being at Rockstargames They have no idea what they want in their own lives and bring all that negativity onto everyone else.,4.0
Oddly regimented for a game companyLittle management supportUnclear and shifting goalsWork/Life Balance just doesn't exist,1.0
The pay could be higher.,5.0
You will be working extreme overtime outside crunch time for low pay. Upper management has little leadership skills and breeds unhealthy environment. You'll have to do your job without sense of direction and lots of ambiguity. Lack of communication causes struggle on both ends to the upper management and employees.,1.0
low salary and endless overtimes,2.0
Sometime you get contradictory instructions on what to do and what the pipeline is due to working internationally.,5.0
You are in charge of your schedule and will not be reminded to upload,5.0
 Lots of freedom can mean ambiguity at times- Hours can get pressing behind a release nothing new to the games biz,4.0

You work a lot even at home.,5.0
You will get to work on some of the most highly-anticipated and highest-rated games in the industry but will come at great cost to your personal life. Rockstar puts their work first and foremost and it is expected that every employee does the same. 50 hours is a minimum work week for many even outside of official crunch time. Work during the weekend or being on-call with a work phone for even non-senior staff is a regular occurrence as well.Tools still tend to be behind relative to other companies with a lot of reliance on manual labor. Communication from management is also very minimal and hearing about large amounts of work needing to done or redone immediately is a common occurrence. Much of the development philosophy is top-down leaving many of the more junior developers little room for collaboration or input.Salary is also much lower than other tech companies and on average lower than most other game companies especially when non-paid overtime is factored in. Bonuses are fairly average even despite the record-setting sales of their games. PTO is average as well but in many cases you will be expected to schedule your PTO around milestones. In some cases you will have your PTO denied if its near a milestone.,3.0
salary might be bad for your field it all depends on what you do,5.0
The Hours- Brutal and unforgiving. 6-7 days a week 9-14 hours a day depending on your deadlines or which upper changed their minds at the last minute and called for a redo on your project causing your entire team to stay long hours (sometimes overnight) to meet your already tight deadline.The Upper Management- Not the greatest of dudes running that place. Never felt a decent connection to anyone above my immediate supervisor while I worked there.The Culture- There was a severe lack of work-to-life balance in the studio particularly for those lower on the ladder. Rockstar Games does not value your family life your personal time or anything about you or your life that lies beyond their doors. They may ask about particular parts of your life but it is usually to get a feel for whether or not you may be considering leaving/quitting.,2.0
Management can be extremely tight lipped and although this is expected in Games where much information needs to be under lock & key it seems to filter down into things need not be confidential. Large gap between upper management and staff in the trenches.,3.0
Very long hours bad work/life balance. Sometimes you didn't know if you'd have the weekend off until 6 pm on Friday. Crunch time is incredibly stressful.,4.0
No consideration for work/life balance. Employees have no choice but to work late and give up their life outside of work because of the constant demand for a fast production pipeline. Good work doesn't come fast especially under sleep deprivation and mental stress. No monetary compensation for OT. Lack of additional resources in order to make full time employees feel supported. Project timelines unrealistic and overly demanding.,1.0
Well they're honest about it but those hours are loooong. It's not for everyone and can get to you after a few years even if it is for you.,4.0
I've found it to be the nature of the business: Since games aren't released every month the workload is very cyclical. At time of business its great and satisfying at slow times work can become tedious.,4.0
Play hard work hard. Everyone expects that you put your best efforts to get your work done even if it means staying late or coming on weekends. No overtime pay.,4.0
Long hours. Sometimes people leave before everything is fixed and others need to stay around while these people are hunted down so they can fix the problems.,5.0
"The rumors are true. You will be treated like a slave.Project is first your life is second or third or eleventh.Crunch for show is the norm. You are forced to be there long hours even when there is nothing to do. Everybody then panics and things have to be done for yesterday.Terrible environment everybody is frustrated. We made the most successful game in the world and everybody was miserable! Get ready to work long hours/weekends for months or years. You will get aggressive emails demanding you to work 6 days a week as a minimum. You will be threatened to be fired if you don't work every weekend and 12 hours a day. Everything is kept in secret so you don't know when the game is supposed to be done and stay late. Then deadlines are pushed and the crunch is extended for another 6 months. This can go on for years.Extremely passive aggressive managers that treat you like a new guy working at McDonalds even if you are very skilled or senior. All managers have this ""you should feel grateful that you work here"" attitude. People hate them with passion.Everybody is afraid of Sam. Everybody is walking on eggshells waiting for him to explode. Managers hide from him what is really going on in the project so he doesn't explode again.Culture of fear. You will get fired if you don't come on the weekend. You will get sued if you talk badly about us. You will get sued or fired for everything!Constant feeling of ""something really bad is about to happen"". My health suffered from it.Managers treat you badly and are extremely moody. Sam screams at them and they scream at the people below them until it reaches you. Horrible horrible atmosphere. Some managers are abusive to the point of illegality but are protected by management. Managers treat people who leave Rockstar as traitors or losers.HR is on Rockstar's side. You feel trapped. You hear horrible stories happening at other Rockstar studios all the time but nothing changes.Really bad technology. RAGE engine is terrible. Crappy tools that are very limiting. Feeling of having to work handcuffed. Things are not automated enough and are done by hand by people that have to stay late. Brute force is the norm. Wouldn't work here again and i don't recommend it to anyone. Forget the prestige. It's not worth it.",1.0
Abusive managmentInsane working hoursLittle creative say in your workConstant micromanaging from aboveVery secretive managementJust incredibly badly organized its hard to express how badly run this company is. Pouring resources and countless (unpaid) OT hours into ill thought out and bloated feature lists.,1.0
my position wasn't thought out well enough before it was offered,3.0
Too much stress too much pressure,5.0
 Hours can be long and take their toll at times. - If you are someone that needs more micro-management it may require some time to get used to the amount of freedom you have here.,5.0
Poor process for replicating success on a consistent basis which leads to a hurky jerky production process that is capable of only overly focusing on 1 title at a time which leads to schedule and cost overruns on other projects in the portfolio. Initial efforts to centralize and leverage talent across all studios/games was a good idea but as key middle and upper level people left the company the ability to share focus diminished. New managers tend to be little more than mouth pieces.,3.0
There's a lot of negativity here. People get depressed fat sleep deprived and generally worse for the wear. It can be frustrating to put so much into projects and have the feedback be uselessly abusive.,3.0
extreme work hours constant crunch mode very little direction from upper management in some departments there does not seem to be a plan on how to elevate employees into new/higher positions so its very easy to reach a ceiling. Not a good place to work if you want to start a family.,3.0
Top management is infamous for burning through cash allowing teams to develop a project with nearly no real direction for years before that project takes the company spotlight at which time it's all hands on deck and they all converge on a single studio from around the world for a year long crunch. Many developers including myself never really had much of a clue what kind of game we were really working on until a...,3.0
