cons,rating_overall
Wide variety means you might not be working on exactly what you want to be doing so the time. The pay is decent considering the area and the games industry but not great.,5.0
Pay is still low for industry standards. You will be told its because its not a west coast studio but what I wish they said is that it makes the company more stable so they don't have to lay people off.,5.0
" Compensation is definitely poor and not comparable among disciplines. Artists have it the worst. - Raises are a joke. They don't event match inflation. The trade-off of ""stability"" wears off fast when your value as a professional decreases the longer you stay. - Promotions don't come with a raise. Only more responsibility. - There's not a lot of room to grow professionally. Even though you will be given a lot of responsibilities it is most certainly because things have to be done fast and cheap. After a few projects it is evident that it is all a lot of the same and it quickly feels like skill stagnation. - The group of people that have been working there the longest are also personal friends of Jesse and management. This means they have a high level of protection and are untouchable. They can do anything and the problem is always someone else. Having this group of people in leadership positions makes for toxic team environments. - There's a weird culture that everyone should be happy and be friends all the time because ""games are fun"" Anyone not drinking from that Kool-Aid gets labeled as difficult to work with.",2.0
"I was shocked to see my old review got ""archived."" The HR people from this company purposely ""archive"" Glassdoor reviews they don't like. The totally review count on their profile page is 23 (not including this one). Somehow they ""archived"" 4 and now there are only 19 available to view. I am very concerning about this terrible behavior. The best way to improve your score is to improve the work environment/benefits for the employees not deleting negative but true reviews from Glassdoor.",1.0
Salaries could be more competitive.,4.0
This is definitely a place that struggles at the compensation level. Sadly it seems like the company fails to gain any kind of momentum even when we see big clients/projects year over year. The result is that pay adjustments barely keep up with the economy and it gives you the sense that you're just treading water as a professional. The client list can leave you star-struck but that loses its luster quickly...,3.0
Lower than average pay No room for growth Other employers can offer more for you especially if you're looking to retire before you die.,2.0
Low pay Little upward momentum,4.0
Mediocre compensation and Inexperienced leadership.,4.0
Have not experienced any cons,5.0
All positions are under paid. Promotions are not tied to pay in anyway. So taking on more responsibilities and being better suited to solve problems is required but not rewarded.,4.0
Not really any for me. If you like to be told what to do every day this is not the place for you. If you like to help create a vision and be a part of a team it's in the top 5 game industry studios I can think of.,5.0
Projects are not necessarily portfolio worthy. Raises are minimal. Artist are considered of less importance.,3.0
Management especially at the VP level. struggles with transparency and hypocrisy at times. Intentions are generally good but even SG is not immune to politicking or occasionally screwing over those in the trenches. Some clients' philosophies or work practices can seem to be at odds with studio culture and philosophy. A necessary evil when requiring client work to pay the bills. Some have pointed out that...,4.0
Medium Sized company ~ 150 people or so commuting is most likely a must.,5.0
Management has terrible communication. No room to advance. You'll be overruled by a fresh ETC hire with no experience just because Jesse likes them. Lots of people who work there are terrible on a professional level. Bad tech decisions will never affect the people making them but you'll likely have to work long hours to deal with it (while they leave at 3PM.),1.0
Unclear career growth. Relatively flat hierarchy.,3.0
They don't do AAA console games so if that is your thing this may not be the place for you.,5.0
Compensation is lower than the industry standard. There are some personalities that are harder to work with.,4.0
Not the smartest group of people,3.0
Number of bathrooms are insufficient.,5.0
The company has very low pay. There is no career growth. Poor technology decisions. Poor leadership. Poor staffing of project directors.,2.0
